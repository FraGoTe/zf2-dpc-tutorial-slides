<p>Where is <code>Zend\EventManager</code> used in <code>Zend\Mvc</code>?</p>

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Events are triggered during bootstrap procedures (to allow customization)</li>
    <li class="fragment">Routing is just a listener, an event is triggered to allow changing the outcome or catching errors</li>
    <li class="fragment">Controller execution is just a part of a "dispatch" listener</li>
    <li class="fragment">The entire view layer can be skipped just by stopping propagation of an event</li>
    <li class="fragment">And so on... there are a lot!</li>
</ul>
